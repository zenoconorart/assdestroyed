# Emoji Asteroids

A small playable asteroids game where the ship, bullets and asteroids are represented with emoji icons: 🍆 for the ship, 💦 for bullets and 🍑 for asteroids.

## Running

Your score increases whenever a 🍑 is destroyed, which triggers a brief brown
explosion effect. Lives are shown as 🍆 icons in the upper-right corner. If you
lose all three lives a game over screen appears. Once every 🍑 is gone a "Level
complete" message pops up. Press `Enter` to continue after losing a life or to
restart after finishing the level or after game over.
shown and you can enter your name alongside your completion time. The background
music pauses when you crash so it doesn't drone on. A "🔕"/"🔔" button centered
above the canvas toggles the music on and off without stealing focus. A running
timer is displayed next to your score.
Press `Enter` to continue after losing a life or to restart after game over or
after recording your high score.

Asteroids move a bit quicker and each level starts with seven of them. Shots fire
in bursts of ten with a slightly slower rate so you must release the space bar
before firing another burst.
