# Emoji Asteroids

A small playable asteroids game where the ship, bullets and asteroids are represented with emoji icons: 🍆 for the ship, 💦 for bullets and 🍑 for asteroids.

## Running

The game includes a soft looping jingle, randomized twinkling stars and simple sound
effects: spurt when you shoot, splat when you crash and a vroom that changes
with speed. On the second level the 🍑 start larger and split into two normal ones
when shot. On level three they begin huge, splitting into three normals and those
split into two small pieces. Clearing the third level shows a scoreboard and plays
a short victory jingle.
Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Use the left/right arrows to rotate
and the up arrow to accelerate. Hold the down arrow to brake; keep holding to
thrust backwards. Press the space bar to shoot.

Your score increases whenever a 🍑 is destroyed, which triggers a brief brown
explosion effect. Lives are shown as 🍆 icons in the upper-right corner. If you
lose all three lives a game over screen appears. Once every 🍑 is gone a "Level
complete" message pops up, except on the final stage where "Game complete" is shown
and you can enter your name in the scoreboard. The background music pauses when
you crash so it doesn't drone on.
Press `Enter` to continue after losing a life or to
restart after game over or after recording your high score.
