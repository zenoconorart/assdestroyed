# Emoji Asteroids

A small playable asteroids game where the ship, bullets and asteroids are represented with emoji icons: 🍆 for the ship, 💧 for bullets and 🍑 for asteroids.

## Running

The game includes a soft looping jingle, randomized twinkling stars and simple
sound effects: spurt when you shoot, splat when you crash, a vroom that changes
with speed and a fart when you destroy a peach. On the second level the 🍑 start
larger and split into two normal-sized ones when hit. On level three the giant
peaches break apart into medium peaches and finally small ones. Clearing the
final stage shows a scoreboard ranked by how quickly you finish and plays a
short victory jingle.
Your score increases whenever a 🍑 is destroyed, which triggers a brief brown poo
scatter effect. Lives are shown as 🍆 icons in the upper-right corner. If you lose
all three lives a game over screen appears. Once every 🍑 is gone a "Level
complete" message pops up, except on the final stage where "Game complete" is
shown and you can enter your name alongside your completion time. The background
music pauses when you crash so it doesn't drone on. A "🔕"/"🔔" button centered
above the canvas toggles the music on and off without stealing focus. A running
timer is displayed next to your score.
Press `Enter` to continue after losing a life or to restart after game over or
after recording your high score.

Asteroids move a bit quicker and each level starts with seven of them. Shots fire
in bursts of ten with a slightly slower rate so you must release the space bar
before firing another burst.
Each shot only travels about half the screen before disappearing, so you need to
get closer to your targets.
